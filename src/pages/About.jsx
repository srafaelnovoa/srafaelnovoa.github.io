        I’m currently a Lead Software Engineer at QuidelOrtho, working on
        content management, automation, and internal reporting systems. I spend
        most of my time building tools for business teams—not consumers.

        I’m exploring new tech like React, Tailwind, Express, and even
        AI/ML—this site is part portfolio, part sandbox.

        I’m not looking for new work or freelance gigs—I just enjoy building
        useful things and sharing what I learn.
